I"Æ<p>Welcome! This is my personal blog. In this blog I document my journey as a beginner front-end developer, share my insights and experiences, lessons Iâ€™ve learnt, mistakes and general advice to beginner developers about programming languages, frameworks and tech stacks. You may find articles about Javascript, Shopify and Liquid templating language or even freelancing as I am currently learning these technologies in order to start freelancing.</p>
