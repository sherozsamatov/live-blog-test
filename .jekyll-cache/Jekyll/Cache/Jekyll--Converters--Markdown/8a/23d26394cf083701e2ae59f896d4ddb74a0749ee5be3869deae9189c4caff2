I"š<p>Welcome to my personal blog! In this blog I will do my best to document my journey as a beginner front-end developer, share my insights and experiences, lessons Iâ€™ve learnt or mistakes I made in order to help someone who might be taking the same path as me. I will write about the solutions to problems I encountered while learning and growing, create tutorials and anything that might be of value to newbie developers. At the moment I am learning Jekyll, Liquid, YAML and Shopify in order to start my freelancing career. Be sure to check out my articles about these technologies as well as how to get started as a freelancer and follow me on social media.</p>
