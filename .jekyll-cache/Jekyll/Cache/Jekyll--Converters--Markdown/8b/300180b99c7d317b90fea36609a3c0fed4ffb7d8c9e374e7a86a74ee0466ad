I"å<p>Thanks for stopping by! I am a beginner programmer, welcome to my blog. This description will be updated again. I will write about various subjects until I find a good niche subject to focus on.
At the moment I am learning Jekyll, Liquid, YAML and Shopify in order to start freelancing. I am into programming, cryptocurrency and finances, so there will probably be posts related to these topics.
The main goal is to expose myself to the programming community and learn as I go.</p>
