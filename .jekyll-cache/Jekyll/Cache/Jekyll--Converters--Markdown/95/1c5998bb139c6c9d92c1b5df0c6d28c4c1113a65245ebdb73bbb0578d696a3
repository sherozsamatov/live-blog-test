I"~<p>Welcome! This is my personal blog. In this blog I document my journey as a beginner front-end developer, share my insights and experiences about programming languages, lessons Iâ€™ve learnt, frameworks and tech stacks. You may find articles about Jacascript, Shopify and Liquid templating language as I am currently learning these technologies in order to start freelancing.</p>
