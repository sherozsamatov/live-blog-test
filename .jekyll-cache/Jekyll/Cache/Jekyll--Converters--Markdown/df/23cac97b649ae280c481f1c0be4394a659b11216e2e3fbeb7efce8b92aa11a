I"Ù<p>Welcome to my personal blog. In this blog I document my journey as a beginner front-end developer, share my insights and experiences, lessons Iâ€™ve learnt, mistakes I made and general advice to beginner developers about programming languages, frameworks and tech stacks. At the moment I am learning Javascript, Shopify and Liquid in order to start my freelancing career. You may find articles about these technologies as well as how to get started as a freelancer.</p>
